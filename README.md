Week 4 Project for Skill Distillery Full Stack Java bootcamp... Quite confidently the coolest program anyone has ever made.
## Overview

## Technologies Used
* Development - Java
* IDE - Eclipse
* Text Editor - Atom
* Distributed Version Control - Git/ Github
* Peer Communication - Slack

## Unique Challenges
* Object Oriented Programming
* Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
* Array Lists 
* Interfaces & Objects
*
*

## Lessons Learned
* ULM was critical in planning a program of this scale. Working out the inheritance chain of interfaces/objects before hand saved a lot of headache.
* Furthering reinforcement of fundamental principles while vastly increasing utilization and working knowledge of OO.
